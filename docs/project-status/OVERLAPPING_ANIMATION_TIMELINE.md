```

### **Key Improvements:**

#### **üéØ Overlapping Design (30-50%):**
- **Camera Movement** continues through model (0-50%)
- **Chaos-to-Order** transition starts at 30% and runs through 70%
- **20% overlap period** where both animations run simultaneously
- Creates a **smooth, natural feeling** where the camera movement and visual transformation work together

#### **üìç Updated Phase Timing:**
```javascript
phases: {
    approach: { start: 0, end: 0.5, duration: 0.5 },        // 0-50%: Camera approach
    transition: { start: 0.3, end: 0.7, duration: 0.4 },   // 30-70%: Chaos to order (OVERLAPS)
    rotation: { start: 0.7, end: 1, duration: 0.3 }         // 70-100%: Rotation & final chaos
}
```

#### **üé¨ Camera Positions (Now with Real Movement):**
```javascript
cameraPositions: {
    start: { x: -100, y: 20, z: 130 },     // Far back starting position
    through: { x: 0, y: 0, z: 20 },        // Close to model - flying through  
    view: { x: 0, y: -30, z: 50 },         // Good viewing angle for order
    end: { x: -50, y: 10, z: 80 }          // Final position with rotation
}
```

### **Animation Flow:**

#### **Phase 1 (0-30%): Pure Camera Approach + Initial Chaos**
- Camera flies from far back (-100,20,130) toward model
- Shader remains in chaos state
- Sets up anticipation for the transformation

#### **Phase 2 (30-50%): OVERLAPPING Camera Movement + Chaos-to-Order**
- **Camera continues** flying through model (0,0,20)
- **Shader begins transition** from chaos to order
- **Overlapping effect** creates natural feeling of "diving into order"

#### **Phase 3 (50-70%): Camera Positioning + Order Completion**
- Camera moves to optimal viewing angle (0,-30,50)
- Shader completes transition to full order state
- Sets up for final rotation phase

#### **Phase 4 (70-100%): Camera Rotation + Return to Chaos**
- Camera rotates around model while moving to final position
- Shader transitions back to chaos
- Completes the full journey

### **Benefits of Overlapping Design:**

#### **üåä Natural Flow:**
- Camera movement and visual transformation feel connected
- No jarring transitions between separate phases
- Smoother overall experience

#### **‚ö° Better Pacing:**
- More dynamic first half with overlapping animations
- Balanced distribution of visual interest
- Natural crescendo in the middle section

#### **üé≠ Storytelling:**
- Camera "dives into" the transformation
- Visual transformation happens as you get closer
- Creates narrative of "approaching order from chaos"

### **Technical Implementation:**
- All timelines remain independent for easy debugging
- Master timeline coordinates overlapping progress
- Proper easing (`power2.inOut`) for smooth transitions
- Maintained cleanup and reset functionality

The overlapping design creates a much more engaging and natural animation flow where the camera movement and shader transformation feel like parts of a cohesive story rather than separate, sequential events.
